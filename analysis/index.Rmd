This project replicates the analysis in the manuscript "SampleQC: robust, multivariate, multi-sample, multi-celltype QC for single cell RNA-seq data", for the R package `SampleQC`.

Analyses:

- [Extracting QC metrics from publicly available datasets](qc01_prep_data.html)
- [Plotting univariate and bivariate distributions of QC metrics in publicly available datasets](qc02_distns.html) (Figs S1, S2)
- [Simulating QC metric data, fitting QC methods and plotting comparisons](qc03_sims.html) (Figs 2, 3, S3, S4, S5, S6)
- [Fitting QC methods to large complex snRNAseq dataset](qc04_real.html) (Figs 4, 5, S8, S9)
- [Applying `SampleQC` to CITE-seq data](qc05_citeseq.html) (Figs S10)
- [Testing robustness of `SampleQC` to mis-specification of _k_](qc06_ks.html) (Figs S7)
